🔍 **Project Overview**
Developed a time-series forecasting model to predict future sales based on historical transaction data. The goal was to help businesses optimize inventory planning and revenue strategies using machine learning.

**Key Features:**
✅ **Data Aggregation:** Processed raw transactional data into daily sales.
✅ **Feature Engineering:** Created lag features, rolling averages, and time-based attributes (day/month/year).
✅** ML Model:** Built a Random Forest Regressor (Scikit-learn) to handle non-linear trends.
✅ **Evaluation:** Achieved ~X% MAE (Mean Absolute Error) against actual sales.
✅ **Visualization:** Generated interactive plots (Matplotlib) for forecasts vs. actuals.
✅ **30-Day Forecast:** Predicted future sales with confidence intervals.
